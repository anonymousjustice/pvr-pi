:FullDescription:
This training course introduces the Print3D class from the PVRTools library. Print3D can be used to display text in both 2D and 3D modes. The default projection mode is 2D but supplying a modelview and projection matrices allow the user to render the text in 3D. Text in different colours is also possible.

Print3D is supplied with a built-in font (Arial Bold) featuring the 7-bit ASCII character set. This font is available in several resolutions and these are chosen depending on the screen size of the device.

It is also possible to supply user-defined fonts from Unicode character sets (as this training course demonstrates) for a fully customised experience.
