:FullDescription:
This training course demonstrates the use of environment mapping with perturbed UVs.  For any given surface on the object a normal map value is read, an angle of reflection between that normal and the eye direction is used to generate a new UV co-ordinate; finally, this UV co-ordinate is used to find the correct colour to reflect from the environment map.
