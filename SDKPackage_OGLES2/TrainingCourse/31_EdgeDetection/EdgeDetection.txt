This training course demonstrates a means of simple edge detection. Four highlighting modes are available:
	-	No Edge Detection (Basic)
	-	Edge Detection 
	-	Edge Detection: Inverse
	-	Edge Detection: Blur

'Edge Detection' mode locates the edges of each object and highlights them with a black line.
'Edge Detection: Inverse' mode locates the edge of each object and highlights them with an inverted colour, all other areas are coloured black.
'Edge Detection: Blur' mode locates the edge of each object and sets the colour of the edge to be a mixture of the surrounding fragments to produce a blur effect.

Controls:
	-	Up/Down	-	Cycle through highlighting modes
	-	Left	-	Decrease the width of edge highlights
	-	Right	-	Increase the width of edge highlights
	-	Esc	-	Close the application
