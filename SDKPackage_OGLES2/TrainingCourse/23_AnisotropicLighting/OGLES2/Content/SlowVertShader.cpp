	" This technique uses the most significant normal to the grained surface (i.e.\r\n"
	" normal in same plane as light vector and eye direction vector) to calculate\r\n"
	" intensities for the diffuse and specular lighting, which create an anisotropic\r\n"
	" effect. The diffuse lighting factor is defined as the dot product of the light\r\n"
	" direction and the normal (L.N). The specular lighting factor is defined as the\r\n"
	" square of the dot product of the view vector (eye direction) and the\r\n"
	" reflection vector ((V.R) * (V.R)). \r\n"
	" For convenience these can be expressed in  terms of the the light direction \r\n"
