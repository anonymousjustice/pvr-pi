:ShortDescription:

:FullDescription:	
A demonstration of a variety of different shaders:
	-	Environment Mapping
	-	Directional Lighting
	-	Anisotropic Lighting
	-	Fast Transform and Lighting
	-	Lattice
	-	Point Lighting
	-	Phong Lighting
	-	Reflection Mapping
	-	Simple Texturing
	-	Spot Lighting
	-	Cell Shading
	-	Sine wave vertex transformation
	-	Procedural wood texturing

Five surfaces are available to display these shaders on:
	-	Torus
	-	Dini's Surface
	-	Boy's Surface
	-	Klein Bottle
	-	Moebius Strip
	
Controls:
	-	Left/Right	-	Cycle backwards/forwards through the list of shaders
	-	Up/Down	-	Cycle backwards/forwards through the list of objects
	-	Esc	-	Close the application
