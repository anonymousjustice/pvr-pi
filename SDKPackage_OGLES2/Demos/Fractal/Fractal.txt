:Title:
Fractal

:ShortDescription:
A demonstration of drawing a fractal using render to texture.

:FullDescription:	
A recursive fractal effect is demonstrated here using the following technique:

Texture 1 refers to the texture attached to the first FBO. Texture 2 refers to the texture attached to the second FBO.

		Frame 0

			1.	We bind the second frame buffer object so we can do things to it.
			2.	We draw two quads with Texture 1 applied.
			3.	We draw the trunk.
			4.	We make the back buffer current.
			5.	We draw 6 quads with Texture 2 applied.

		Frame 1

			6.	We bind the first frame buffer object so we can do things to it.
			7.	We draw two quads with Texture 2 applied. Texture 2 still contains
				the image from the last frame.
			8.	We draw the trunk.
			9.	We make the back buffer current.
			10.	We draw 6 quads with Texture 1 applied.

		Frame 2

			11.	We bind the second frame buffer object so we can do things to it.
			12.	We draw two quads with Texture 1 applied. Texture 1 still contains
				the image from the last frame.
			13.	We draw the trunk.
			14.	We make the back buffer current.
			15.	We draw 6 quads with Texture 2 applied.

			16.	We repeat steps 6 through to 15 for consecutive frames.
